##This is just an idea 

Don't use it, it won't work for you, it might not work for me once I test it properly.

This is a WordPress plugin which is an attempt to extract my commonly used node modules, put them in a file that can be cached and use them anywhere. So cache the 300k file here and then load the little plugin js files elsewhere (they're teeny tiny without the overhead of the required packages).

You can see how I've used it in [the "dependent" branch of the mjj-faq plugin](https://github.com/tharsheblows/mjj-faq/tree/dependent)


##caveats and disclaimers

This is mainly a proof of concept.
